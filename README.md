## Description

Blitz Bombz is an ecommerce site focused on selling bath bombs for men. 

We know that after a long day of working in a cubicle, out in the wilderness, working on your muscles or just simply taking care of the little wild ones, men just simply need some down time. 

Here at Blitz Bombz we are focused on only using the best ingredients to target your needs.
